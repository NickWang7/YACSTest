Played around with some functions and api calls to test and see whether my printing on my tables would work. 
So far, I've watched a few videos and tested some things out but I cannot get it to print through YACS.
Will be working on this more and updating as I go.

Continued to learn and read over YACS documentation to figure out how to print out everything. 
I have currently gotten my table to print but the logicistics and the formatting is still a bit off.
Nonetheless, I think I am making good progress as one of the big things is now out of the way.
