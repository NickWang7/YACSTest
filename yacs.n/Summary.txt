Played around with some functions and api calls to test and see whether my printing on my tables would work. 
So far, I've watched a few videos and tested some things out but I cannot get it to print through YACS.
Will be working on this more and updating as I go.

Continued to learn and read over YACS documentation to figure out how to print out everything. 
I have currently gotten my table to print but the logicistics and the formatting is still a bit off.
Nonetheless, I think I am making good progress as one of the big things is now out of the way.

Managed to figure out some formatting issues that were holding me back. Started to play around with api
code and documentation but will not commit any actual code yet since it does not work. Getting some
errors with my code connecting to the server so I will look over that tomorrow after my test when
I have more time.

Had a busy day today so I didnt get too much of a chance to work on things. I kept working and testing
out portions of my API code and I no longer have connection issues but my code is just wrong. I will
continue to work on this tomorrow after sleep.
